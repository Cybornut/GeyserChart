This is the work-in-progress version of the Geyser/Floodgate structure overview.

It's at the moment still named "at a glance" but it's grown beyond that.

The oldest version is v7, since I was too lazy to keep the previous versions, or learn github.

Anyhow, use it how you want.



I'm a programming noob... so you know... something something deal with it.
